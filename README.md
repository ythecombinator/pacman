# pacman

> Pacman game made in C.

## Instructions

To run this application you need to compile all `.c` files and generate just only one executable file.

Just run:

`gcc -std=c99 pacman.c mapa.c ui.c -o pacman.out`

> **Note:** I made this game in C as a *C99* extension - this is the why you need to use the `-std=c99` flag to build.
